        <td><p>Hi! My name is Lauren Mahkovic, I am a 20 year old artist based out of Greensburg, Pennsylvania. 
I am currenly a college student studying geology, biology, and museum studies, all of which heavily
influence my artistic work. I primarily do digital work but also commonly use ink, watercolor, and 
lino-cut block prints. I have competed in several art competitions in my home town and have recived a 
few awards for my work. Additionally I have also had my work featured in a gallery for the Southern Allegheny Museum of Art
in Ligonere, PA. My artwork is heavily infulenced by my passion for science and nature, I have done several paleoartistic 
illustraions for personal and academic use. A website that I commonly use for refrences in my scientific illustraion is the 
<a href="https://ucmpdb.berkeley.edu/Invert_orders2.html">Univerity of California Berkeley invertebrate zoology collection.</a> An additonal infulence for my work is the Czech arist Alphonz Mucha, 
a pioneer of the art nouvue movement from the 1920's, examples of his work can be <a href="https://www.muchafoundation.org/en">here.</a> Block printing is an artisitc tradtion found 
across the world for thousands of years, but isn't as popular in modern works as compared to other mediums. It quickly became one of my 
favorite ways to create reproducable works of art, a great resource to learn more about block printing can be found at the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/perspectives/materials-and-techniques-printmaking-woodcut">Metropolitan 
Museum of Art's website.</a></p></td>
